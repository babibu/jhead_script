# jhead_script
A small wrapper around jhead to merge pictures from multiple cameras.

To run the script adjust the jhead function so that it points to your jhead executable. jhead is from Matthias Wandel and can be found here http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/index.html 

Example execution
<code>./merge.sh -a ./Pictures/AdjustDate/IMG_1.JPG -m ./Pictures/Merge/IMG_2.JPG -p TST</code>
